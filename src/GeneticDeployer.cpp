 * 1. Fitness function: It would be nice if chromosome was a class with implemented fitness function.
 * 2. Selection: based on Fitness function. Fittest should survive. But there should be some probability function that would sometimes let less fitests individuals survive. This should create pairs of chromosomes.
 * 3. Crossover: This should randomly merge two chromosomes from pairs into new pair or maybe one individual.
 * 4. Mutation: Random probability for random change of genes.
 * 5. Termination: a) stop if no significant change is made between generations.
 * b) Maybe time.

/*
 * Chromosome -> handle solution and it's score. Also it should have logic to calculate fitness.
 *              -> store also shared pointer to all developers and managers
 *              3
 * GeneticDeployer -> create random solutions stored in std::array
 *                  -> think about some way to swap data between them.
